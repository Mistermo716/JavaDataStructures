      //Remember Arrays beginning insertions are O(N)

      //Inserting at the end of a linkedlist is O(N)
      //traverse until the end pointing to null
      //Remember Arrays end insertions are O(1)

      //Removing items in the beginning is O(1)

      //Removing at a given point is O(N)
      //must search for the node.

      //deletion much quicker using LinkedLists because you simply have
      //node point to next node.
      //Arrays you need to shift the indexes.

      //LinkedLists use alot of space.
